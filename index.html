				Hi, I am currently a junior at Rutgers University - New Brunswick pursuing a Bachelor's in computer science with a minor in mathematics. 
				My anticipated graduation is in the winter of 2021.
			<br>
			<br>
				I have been programming for about 4 years now. When I started off, I spent a lot of time working with Java and am still using it since it is my strongest programming language. 
				In my exploration of new languages, I have slowly increased my exposure to web development and using HTML/CSS. I have had limited experience with C and moderate experience with Python. 
				I started learning Python when I was exploring machine learning and artificial intelligence. Now, I have worked on a few full stack projects that have incorporated different back-end languages and one that involves SQL and JDBC.
			<br>
			<br>
				My hobbies and interests include playing and watching sports as well as hiking. Overall, I enjoy being active when I'm not working inside. Feel free to reach out to me using any of the contact information below!
